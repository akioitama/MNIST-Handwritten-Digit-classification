# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-classification
This project implements a machine learning model to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to recognize digits from 0 to 9, demonstrating basic image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques.

Key Features:

Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset of 28x28 grayscale images.

Implements a classification model using [specify model: e.g., Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)].

Evaluates model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix.

Visualizes sample predictions and misclassified images for better understanding.

Tech Stack:
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on your implementation)

Use Cases:

Beginner-friendly introduction to image classification.

Foundation for more advanced computer vision projects.

Can be extended to real-time digit recognition applications.
